# 4XX-Availability-Checker
Scraper for The University of Maryland's course listings to check availability of 4XX level computer science courses.

Refreshing multiple tabs every so often was quite annoying so I created this to view any class availability by section, all at once.

Currently very early stage. It works but I do not plan on providing any documentation. Uses Cheerio to scrape specified paths based on url pattern.

I noticed that there was substantial lag in number of open-seats in real-time vs. what is displayed on testudo "Schedule of Classes", so this may not be insanely useful.
